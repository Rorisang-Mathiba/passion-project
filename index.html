            <h3>Why is Nicki Minaj the Queen of Rap?</h3>
            <p>
              Minaj is one of the world's best-selling music artists, and the
              best-selling female rapper, with over 100 million records sold.[1]
              She has three diamond-certified songs by the RIAA and in 2024
              became the first female rapper with multiple diamond-certified
              solo songs. She is among the RIAA's 50 highest-certified digital
              singles artists.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2023, Billboard and Vibe ranked Minaj as the greatest female
              rapper of all time. Her various accolades include a Brit Award,
              five Billboard Music Awards, nine American Music Awards, eight MTV
              Video Music Awards (including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard
              Award), 13 BET Awards, a Soul Train Music Award, and three
              Guinness World Records. Time named her one of the 100 most
              influential people in the world in 2016, and she was honored with
              the Billboard Women in Music Game Changer Award in 2019.
